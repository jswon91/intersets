  <h2>Surfing</h2>
  <p>Surfing is <strong>a surface <u>water pastime</u></strong> in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward part, or face, of a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.

However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.</p>
